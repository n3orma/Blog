Just like jumping off a trampoline pushes you up when you push it down, the toy feels a push upward. This is called thrust. If this upward thrust is stronger than the toy's weight, the toy lifts off the ground and flies into the air."

At this point, it neither goes up nor comes down, but simply stays in place. If we increase the motor speed, it produces more thrust and rises. If we decrease the speed, it produces less thrust and comes down. So just by changing the speed, we can control the height."

The farther the motor is from the center, the stronger this turning effect becomes. So now instead of getting stable lift, we get a combination of lift and rotation, which makes the system unstable."

This causes the stick to tilt. Once it tilts, the thrust is no longer pointing straight up — it is slightly angled. This angled thrust creates movement in a direction."
